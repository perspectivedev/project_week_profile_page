            Hello. My name is Marvis Knight. 
            I am seeking a position in the [tech industry] field.
            I have over a year of experience as a teacherâ€™s assistant and programming. 
            I have strong listening skills and I have knowledge of HTML, CSS, programming languages, and Front-end and Back-end. 
            I have helped individuals and classroom sizes as large as 20 people understand curriculum. 
            These skills and knowledge were effectively communicated and motivated students to accomplish coursework. 
            I provided input for coursework and made effective adjustments for the benefit of students. 
            I can handle challenges, and my former instructor will verify that I work independently or as a team member.
